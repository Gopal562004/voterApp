Sure, here's an example of what your README file for the voter app might look like:

# Voter App

The Voter App is a web application designed to facilitate voting processes. It allows users to register as candidates or voters, view candidates, vote for candidates, and view the vote count for each candidate.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can sign up as candidates or voters.
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin users can manage candidates, while regular users can only vote.
- **Candidate Management**: Admin users can add, update, and delete candidates.
- **Voting System**: Users can vote for their preferred candidates.
- **Vote Count**: Display of vote count for each candidate.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend server environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and candidate data.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Authentication mechanism.
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing for user authentication.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Gopal562004/node_hotels.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd voter-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/voter-app
   JWT_SECRET=yoursecretkey
   ```

   Replace `yoursecretkey` with a secret key of your choice for JWT authentication.

5. Run the application:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. The server will start running at `http://localhost:3000`.
